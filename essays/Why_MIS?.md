I was originally a mechanical engineering major. However, as I was taking their team project oreiented classes, I saw that many of the students that I would be taking classes and doing projects for 4 years 
had a hard time talking to each other. So, in an attempt to find something that was more sociable I talked to my friends and he explained to me that MIS is basically computer science, but with a social aspect and that was when I decided to change my major to MIS.
