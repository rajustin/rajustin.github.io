1. My programming skills have greatly improved.

My programming skills compared to before has im proved a lot, but I came into this class not even knowing the differences between HTML and JavaScript. 
I may have more knowledge about programming now, but I did have a hard time keeping up in class and doing everything neccessary. It was hard for me to keep up when I didn't know much to begin with.

2. I am enthusiastic about programming.

ITM 352 was hard and moved quite fast. However, I did enjoy seeing my code work and run smoothly so I am qquite excited about coding.

3. I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.

For most part yes, but I did have trouble on some parts and the WODs without screencast took me many tries to complete it.

4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.

The labs helped me learn more than I have before, but it didn't teach me well enough I believe because we were moving a bit too fast. I did want to learn more but by the time I finished copying things down we were already couple steps ahead

5. I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).

No, I still don't feel confident enough to build much yet. I understand that we have to look things up on our own but I'm not sure what to look up at all at times.

6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning.

It was the first semester of Javascript and it wasn't bad or anything, but yes I feel like things could've been a bit more slow at times or in different order for te labs.

7. There are things that work really well my learning in this class.

I enjoyed that we did labs together and that you were willing to meet up often or help out a lot. The lab also helped us practice real life scenarios and the WODs as hard as they were helped a bunch too.
