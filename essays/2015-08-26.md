Hello world, this isn't exactly my first coding class, but I have'nt had the chance to learn coding too much. I was always intrested in coding, science and computers and I'm very excited to learn everything that ITM 352 has to offer.

About myself though, I like to do a lot of outdoor activities but I also enojy indoor activities too! I always loved hiking and going to the beach, but I also like to watch a lot of movies and TV shows, my favorite movie series basically being the whole Marvel franchise. 

Just to put a fun fact about me in here, when someone asks me to tell them something they would never guess about me or something similar to that for ice breakers I always have one fact that I tell them. This little tidbit about myself is that before I lived here on Oahu I was actually living in South Africa. Everyone that I've told this to would always look baffled and suprised!

Anyways, I hope we all get along and have a fun time in ITM 352!
