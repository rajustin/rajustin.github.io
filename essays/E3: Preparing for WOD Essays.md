  With WOD: Invoice1 I made a receipt that includes 5 items, their price, and subtotal. This wasn’t hard coded where, if I changed the price in one variable, it would also change throughout the whole code, using variable and referencing it. 
  
  For the most part Invoice1 wasn’t too bad and quite straightforward, I didn’t have a hard time going through the first few steps. However, I began to have a hard time with creating the table and formatting it correctly, to fix this I stopped my timer and looked up ways to make and format tables. After I watch the screencast, just so that I could see someone else utilizing the codes to make the tables and base mines off of it. After I felt comfortable enough to retry, I started over and started my timer again.
  
  What I did similarly to the previous WOD is that I attempted to do them on my own without any help first. This allowed me to see where I got stuck and which parts I didn’t have a clear grasp of.
	
  To be better prepared, what I could’ve done is review the WOD before I actually attempted it and research the required codes and practice it beforehand.
